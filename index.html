        <h2>1. Apples Are Nutritious</h2>
        <p>A medium apple — with a diameter of about 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) — equals 1.5 cups of fruit. Two cups of
            fruit daily are recommended on a 2,000calorie diet.One medium apple — 6.4 ounces or 182 grams — offers the
            following nutrients (1Trusted Source):
        <ul>
            <li>Calories: 95</li>
            <li>Fiber: 4 grams</li>
            <li>Carbs: 25 grams</li>
            <li>Vitamin C: 14% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) </li>
            <li> Potassium: 6% of the RDI</li>
            <li>Vitamin K: 5% of the RDI</li>
        </ul>
        What’s more, the same serving provides 2–4% of the RDI for manganese, copper, and the vitamins A, E, B1, B2, and
        B6.Apples are also a rich source of polyphenols. While nutrition labels don’t list these plant compounds,
        they’re likely responsible for many of the health benefits.To get the most out of apples, leave the skin on — it
        contains half of the fiber and many of the polyphenols.

        <h2>2. Apples May Be Good for Weight Loss</h2>

        <p> Apples are high in fiber and water — two qualities that make them filling.In one study, people who ate apple
            slices before a meal felt fuller than those who consumed applesauce, apple juice, or no apple products
            (2Trusted Source).In the same study, those who started their meal with apple slices also ate an average of
            200 fewer calories than those who didn’t (2Trusted Source).In another 10-week study in 50 overweight women,
            participants who ate apples lost an average of 2 pounds (1 kg) and ate fewer calories overall, compared to
            those who ate oat cookies with a similar calorie and fiber content (3Trusted Source).Researchers think that
            apples are more filling because they’re less energy-dense, yet still deliver fiber and volume.Furthermore,
            some natural compounds in them may promote weight loss.A study in obese mice found that those given a
            supplement of ground apples and apple juice concentrate lost more weight and had lower levels of “bad” LDL
            cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol than the control group </p>

        <h2>Apples May Be Good for Your Heart</h2>
        <p>> Apples have been linked to a lower risk of heart disease (5Trusted Source).One reason may be that apples
            contain soluble fiber — the kind that can help lower your blood cholesterol levels.They also contain
            polyphenols, which have antioxidant effects. Many of these are concentrated in the peel.One of these
            polyphenols is the flavonoid epicatechin, which may lower blood pressure.An analysis of studies found that
            high intakes of flavonoids were linked to a 20% lower risk of stroke (6Trusted Source).Flavonoids can help
            prevent heart disease by lowering blood pressure, reducing “bad” LDL oxidation, and acting as antioxidants
            (7Trusted Source).Another study comparing the effects of eating an apple a day to taking statins — a class
            of drugs known to lower cholesterol — concluded that apples would be almost as effective at reducing death
            from heart disease as the drugs (Trusted Source).However, since this was not a controlled trial, findings
            must be taken with a grain of salt.Another study linked consuming white-fleshed fruits and vegetables, such
            as apples and pears, to a reduced risk of stroke. For every 25 grams — about 1/5 cup of apple slices —
            consumed, the risk of stroke decreased by 9%

        </p>
        <h2>They’re Linked to a Lower Risk of Diabetes</h2>
        <p>Several studies have linked eating apples to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (10Trusted Source).In one large
            study, eating an apple a day was linked to a 28% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, compared to not eating any
            apples. Even eating just a few apples per week had a similarly protective effect (11Trusted Source).It’s
            possible that the polyphenols in apples help prevent tissue damage to beta cells in your pancreas. Beta
            cells produce insulin in your body and are often damaged in people with type 2 diabetes</p>
        <h2>hey May Have Prebiotic Effects and Promote Good Gut Bacteria</h2>
        <p>Apples contain pectin, a type of fiber that acts as a prebiotic. This means it feeds the good bacteria in
            your gut.Your small intestine doesn’t absorb fiber during digestion. Instead, it goes to your colon, where
            it can promote the growth of good bacteria. It also turns into other helpful compounds that circulate back
            through your body New research suggests that this may be the reason behind some of the protective effects of
            apples against obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease</p>
